		<h2>About Me:</h2>
		<p>Hi my name is Jennifer, I am a second-year student at Brown University. I currently intend to concentrate in Computer Science. I am currently interested in Software Engineering, Systems and Cybersecurity. <br> <br> 
			I am currently very active on campus. Personally, I really enjoy the full schedule! I am currently on the executive board for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, on the branding team for Mosaic+, am a coordinator for the Sidney Frank E. Scholars Program and am on the Diversity Advocate Board for Brown University. <br> <br> Other interests of mine included small dogs (I have 4 pet Chihuahuas), basketball, playing piano, and listening to a wide variety of music! </p>
