			<h2>React</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this project was to create a site in React that sorted and filtered a set of information.</p>

			<h3>Preparing the Design</h3>
			<p>I began this project by designing and planning out what it was I wanted my site to do. I decided on making a dog filter. That is, a site that sorts and filters dogs by their name, color and size. </p>

			<h3>The Site</h3>
			<p>My interface relates to the user interface design principles I have learned in class because I tried to follow several important features. First, legibility is something I took into consideration while choosing fonts. Given that my site is made up of primarily 3 things: Title, buttons, and data, I had to make sure each thing was presented in an appropriate manner. Another thing I tried to have was to have a clear division between the three different areas. That is, have a site in which you can easily tell apart what is supposed to be the title, the area where the user can enter their input and the area where the results of the input will appear. Finally, I used a color palette to choose background colors. Since my pictures were going to have different colors, in order to make them pop-out, I chose softer colors for the background.</p>

			<h3>Functionality</h3>
			<p>My site had 4 major functional components. The first 2 included filtering. This first dropdown button (going from left to right) filtered the page by color. The dropdown button, when selected, diplayed all the different colors available. After selecting a color, the page only displayed the dogs of that color. A user is able to go back to the default page by selecting all. The next dropdown button filtered the page by size. The final dropdown sorted the page. This dropdown button had two choices. That is, whether to have it ordered, which means in alphabetical order or in disorder, which means <i>not</i> in alphabetical order. The final component was the search bar. The search bar was able to filter the page components by name, color or size. Finally, the components were able to work at the same time. That is, if you chose a color and size, the page would only display the dogs of that color <strong>and</strong> size.</p>

			<h6>Figure 3: Shows some site functionality.</h6>
			<p>Finally, the goal of my application is to be able to easily filter dogs with specific traits, and be able to order them by name or be able to search for them (search works for either name, size or color). This would be valuable to a user who is trying to look for a specific dog with specific traits.</p>
