			<h2>Storyboarding</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this project was to create mental models and personas for a specific interface. This included annotating interfaces, interviewing a diverse set of users, creating the mental model and creating a storyboard for our persona.</p>

			<h3>Choosing an Interface</h3>
			<p>The first step was to create a publicly accessible interface. I chose SignMeUp because it is greatly used within the Computer Science Department at Brown University</p>

			<h6>Figure 1: An example of one of the sketches I made for the interface with the necessary annotations.</h6>
			<p>The next step was to create sketches for the most important screens and annotate them. That is, identify important, key features. After this, I created a set of questions and interviewed different people about the interface.</p>

			<h3>Personas</h3>
			<p>The next step was to create personas. After collecting the necessary information, summarizing it and analyzing it, I came up with two different mental models. I came up with two different personas, Jill and Bill. Jill's mental model of SignMeUp was A site that is very useful when it comes to TA hours. Maybe having a place to put our questions, so the TA has an idea of where to start, a suggestion box where suggested questions are added and a place to sign in, so they know who we are and in what class we are. Because of this model Jill has of the site, she is expecting to see a detailed site, such that it will allow the TA to already have an idea of what the problem is. She is also expecting to login so she can secure a spot, in the right class, with the right TA. Bill's mental model of SignMeUp that is very easy to use and very organized when it comes to TA hours. Since Bill is also interested in doing everything as fast as possible, he does not expect to login, and expects to do nothing except write his name and sign up. He also hopes that the site will have some indication of how much time is left until he is attended, similarly to setting up appointments. Because of Bill's mental model he is expecting to see a very simple site and is expecting that signing up will take seconds and he will know exactly when he is going to be seen by a TA. </p>

			<h6>Figure 2: Shows an example of a persona on the left, and a four-quadrant​ ​empathy​ ​map on the right. </h6>
			<p>The other task was to create a four-quadrant​ ​empathy​ ​map for each persona. Each empathy map showed what the persona thinks, feels, says and does. The empathy map also includes a quick summary. Jill's summary was that she is a new freshman who is currently in CS17. She is not very interested in CS17, and is really only taking it because her friends are in it. She is a humanities concentrator and honestly just wants a passing grade. She hopes to get good grades on her assignments in the beginning of the semester so she does not need to stress towards the end. She arrived 15 minutes before TA hours and is using a department computer to sign up for TA hous. She is starting the assignment 2 weeks early. Bill is a busy junior who is currently in CS33. Although he finished his other 2 CS projects with time to spare, he is doing poorly on his current CS33 project. As a CS concentrator, he needs to get an A in this class, which means he needs an A on this assignment. His math class ended 5 minutes before TA hours and needs to make sure he can get enough help before he leaves in 2 hours. </p>

			<h3>Storyboard</h3>
			<p>The final part of the assignment was to create a storyboard of the persona. This simply showed an example of what an interaction betweent the persona and the site would be.</p>
