			<h2>Iterative Redesign</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this project was to design a website for a startup using the principles we learned throughout our UI/UX class.</p>

			<h3>Sketching</h3>
			<p>The first part of the project consisted of sketching multiple versions of the 'ideal' website. This ended up totaling up to 12 different sketches of 4 different screens which we identified as most important. While coming up with these sketches we made sure to keep in mind important principles we learned in class and through readings. This includes (but isn't limited to) things like readability, memorability, and user-friendliness. </p>

			<h6>Figure 1: Example of a sketch. This particular sketch is the earliest version of what I had in mind for the social/leader board.</h6>
			<p>After gathering these sketches, we critiqued each. This way, we were able to identify strong and weak components of each different sketch and be able to come up with an interface that took all the strong components of the sketches. While identifying the strong components, again, we tried to keep in mind the principles we learned throughout our class. </p>

			<h3>Mockups</h3>
			<p>After going through our sketches we began the next phase. That is, the construction of a High-Fidelity prototype. Our prototype consisted of 16 screens and was able to conduct basic functionality, however, nothing too specific. We made our protoype on the figma site, and a link to it can be found at the end of this projects page.</p>

			<h6>Figure 2: Example of a high-fidelity version of the leaderboard. As you can see, this version is different than the one seen in figure 1. That is because this contains a combination of different components from the different sketches our group came up with. We also made sure to include more principles we learned in our UI/UX class. </h6>

			<h6>Figure 3: Shows the different screens and how they link to other pages. </h6>
			<p>After constructing our prototype, we conducted two different critique sessions. The first was an in-class critique where colleagues gave us constructive critisms. Examples of input we recieved included things like changing the color pallete, moving a couple of the objects on the page, and using a consistent font. After gathering the critiques, we edited our prototype again.</p>

			<h3>UserTesting</h3>
			<p>For the final phase of User Testing, we campe up with a hypothesis on how users would interact with our prototype, and shared our website with strangers to get their input. Our demographics we all and any user. The way this worked was we assigned the user a couple of tasks, which they had to complete using our prototype. After completing the tasks, we asked them a couple of questions. In the end, we found our hypothesis to be mostly true. After this final user testing, we found that our color palette was still a little odd, and our prototype may benefit from changing it. Other functionality critisms we recieved included usability issues and some recommended display methods. To conclude, it was interesting working with user testing and Hi-Fidelity Prototyping. Some unexpected challenges included wanting extensive functionality, but also keeping an intuitive design in mind.</p>
